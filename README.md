## Simple React Native + EXPO Webviewer

This opens your web application at some URL in a native app for a more cohesive app experience.

Simply change the endpoint in the App.js file to whatever address you're attempting to go to.

You can also look in `assets` to change the splash screen and icon.

## Getting Started
- `clone` repo and `cd` into it
- `npm install`
- `expo start`

This should bind the Expo debugger to some port on your computer. You can then use the QR code and connect over LAN or Tunneling

Make sure you have the **newest** expo app on your phone or else it wont work! You can also plug your phone up to your computer and
in the console running the expo debugger use the commands to build on android or iOS.
